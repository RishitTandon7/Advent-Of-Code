# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 Solutions 🎄

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** solutions! Every year, I look forward to the daily coding challenges provided by Advent of Code, and this repository serves as a collection of my solutions for **2024**.

Each day, a new puzzle presents an interesting problem that allows me to refine my skills, experiment with new algorithms, and have fun while doing it. This repository contains my solutions for each day's puzzle, written in various languages that I'm exploring throughout the year. Feel free to browse, contribute, or simply get inspired!

## 📝 How to Use

To get the correct answers for each day's challenge, you need to make sure the **input data** is updated for that specific day. Each day contains its own input file, and the code reads from these files to calculate the solution.  
So, don’t forget to change the data in the input file for each day to ensure you get the correct answers.

## 🔄 Repository Structure

- Each day’s solution will be in its own folder, organized by day number (e.g., `Day01`, `Day02`, etc.).
- The input data for each day is stored in a text file, typically named `input.txt`.
- The solution file for each day will be written in the programming language of my choice for that day.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Input Files**: Make sure you download or update the input files for each day, as these contain the necessary data for solving the puzzles.
- **Language Used**: I've used a variety of programming languages throughout this repository, including **Python**, **JavaScript**, **C++**, and others. Each solution is stored in a separate file to make it easy to find the solution for a specific day.
- **Solution Approach**: For each problem, I try to approach the solution with both simplicity and efficiency in mind, while also experimenting with new algorithms and techniques.
